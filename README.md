I am an advanced Data Engineer who loves data use. I believe that data can help us make correct decisions based on facts.
My favorite programming language is Python and I have a lot of experience working with it. Some of the projects that I have seen with this tool are:

- Web Scraping
- Reading PDFs
- Data cleaning
- Solve Catpchas

I also have knowledge of the Scala programming lenguage and I love how useful it is. I am learning Spark and creating some projects whit it. I invite you to check my repositories and give me your feedback.
